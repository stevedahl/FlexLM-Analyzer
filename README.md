# FlexLM-Analyzer
This github is to capture the powershell script versions for analyzing a FLEXlm debug log file for concurrent usage.

earlier versions would do this on a 5 minute increment for concurrent usage.
the latest version 1.7 will report based on a 1 hour increment which makes the amount of output data more managable to work with and display.

future plans are to also allow a setting to report the maximum usage during the hour period rather than the usage at the top of each hour.
